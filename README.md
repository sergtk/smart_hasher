# smart_hasher

## Rationale

This app is to check hashes of files with extended features.

One of cases e.g. if it is needed to check integrity of the large files with the slow connection. In such case network interruption may happened, slow speed and/or hang up.

So it is good to quickly diagnose such issues. And if the job is interrupted, it should be easy to continue, preserving previously generated hashes.
